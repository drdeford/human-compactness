A custom aggregation function: take the square root


## Interpretation of results


At the district level, compactness measures all agree with one another quite
well.

But at the aggregate level, they don't always agree. The geographic compactness
measures do agree with each other, but they don't always agree with the human
compactness metric.
	--> probably because of cities


To be sure, correlation is
often

First, compactness measures all track spatial diversity quite well, to the tune
of anywhere between ~0.3 to 

The correspondence between compactness measures of spatial diversity 


In New Hampshire (state 33), human compactness outperforms

New Hampshire is an almost all-white state.

but so is Idaho
